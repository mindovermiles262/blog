# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 is used to store flat files (objects) like PDFs and Word Documents. It can also be used to host static websites.

## The Basics

S3 is Object based:
  * Key (Object Name)
  * Value (Data)
  * Version ID
  * Metadata
  * Subresources:
    * ACLs
    * Torrent

* Built for 99.99% Availability, AWS guarantee 99.9% availability, 11x9s Durability
* Read after write for PUTS of new Objects (New objects uploaded are available immediatly)
* Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (May take some time for changes to a file to propogate)

### Storage Tiers

* S3 Standard => 99.99% availibility, 11x9 durability. Stored in multiple locations designed to sustain lost of 2 facilities concurrently
* S3-IA (Infrequent Access) => Lower storage fee, but charged retrieval fee
* S3 One Zone - IA => Not replicated across multiple AZs. Lower cost than S3-IA. 
* Glacier => Cheapest. Archival Only
  * Glacier Expedited => Restored within a few minutes
  * Glacier Standard => 3-5 hour restore
  * Glacier Bulk => 5-12 hour restore

### Pricing

You're charged for all of the following:

* Storage
* Requests
* Storage Management
* Data Transfer
* Transfer Acceleration => Upload files to CloudFront Edge Location, then "syncs" to S3 via AWS Backbone

### Security & Encryption

* By default, all buckets are private.
* You can set up access controls by using:
  * Bucket Policy => Rules apply to bucket
  * ALCs => Rules apply to users

* Buckets can create access logs which can be saved in other S3 buckets

Encryption Types:

* Client side encryption
* In Transit => SSL/TLS
* At Rest (Server Side Encryption):
  * Client-Side Encryption
    * SSE-S3 => Each object encrypted with AWS S3 Managed Keys (AES-256 bit encryption)
    * SSE-KMS => Provides audit trail, advanced usage
    * SSE-C => Customer Provided Keys

### Versioning

Tracks and records all versions of an object. Similar to git.

* Cannot be disabled, can only be suspended
* MFA Authentication can be enabled for deleting an object

### Cross Region Replication

Copies objects from one region to another for redundancy.

* Versioning must be enabled for both buckets
* Files in existing bucket ARE NOT replicated automatically
* New files to existing buckets are replicated automatically
* DELETE markers are not replicated
* Deleting versions (or delete markers) are not replicated

### Lifecycle Management (S3-IA & Glacier)

Set up rules to determine which storage tier to use. For example you can set it up such that after 30 days in S3, the object is moved to S3-IA, then, 30 days later (60 days after creation) the object is moved to Glacier.

* Can be used to permanently delete objects

## Storage Gateway

Service that connects on-prem software with cloud-based storage. It provides integration between on-prem datacenters and AWS S3.

You download the Storage Gateway VM in your datacenter, then configure it to your use cases

There are four types of Storage Gateways
* File Gateway (NFS) => Files stored in S3. Gateway Appliance/Bucket is mounted on local OS as NFS Storage.
* Volume Gateways => Block-Based Storage. Use iSCSI Adapter. Backed up to S3 as point-in-time snapshots. Snapshots are incremental. Two types of Volume Gateways:
  * Stored Volumes => All data stored on-prem while being backed up to AWS.
    * Use when low-latency access is needed to data
    * Can store 1GB to 16 TB
  * Cached Volumes => Use S3 as primary data storage. Only most frequent data is stored on-prem.
    * No need for large storage arrays on-prem
    * Stores 1GB to 32 TB
* Tape Gateway (VTL) => Uses existing backup system (Veeam, NetBackup, BackupExec, etc) to store virtual tapes in S3

## Transfer Acceleration

Utilizes CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your S3 uploads.

`myexample.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com`

User connects to closest edge location, then that edge location uses the AWS Backbone to optimize data transfer. The AWS backbone is a lot faster than the global internet.

## Static Web hosting

S3 can be used to host static websites. You will need to enable public access to the bucket.

The URL of the website will be: `bucketname.s3-website.amazonaws.com`

To set up the hosting, click the "Properties" tab in the bucket. Then folow the "Static Website Hosting" dialog. You can also add a bucket policy so that everything in the bucket is public by default.

## S3 Summary & Exam Tips

* S3 is object based storage. It alows you to upload files.
* Files can be 0Bytes to 5TB, Unlimited Storage. You're charged for what you use
* Fies are stored in buckets
* S3 namespace is universal - Buckets must have unique name
* URL Format: `https://s3-region-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname` 
  * Example: `https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/myfirstbucket`
* Read after write consistency for PUTS; Eventual consistancy for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
* Storage Tiers => S3, S3-IA, S3-OneZone-IA, Glacier
* Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled. It can only be suspended.
* By Defaul, all buckets are PRIVATE. You can make them public via Bucket Policies and ACLs
* S3 buckets are be configured to create access logs
* Encryption - In transit && At Rest
* Storage Gateway - 4 types: File Gateway, Volume Gateway (2 types: Stored Volumes & Cached Volumes), Virtual Tape Libraries
* Snowball
* S3 Transfer Acceleration
* Can host STATIC websites on S3
* Successful write to S3 results in HTTP 200
* Enable Multipart uploads to decrease upload time
