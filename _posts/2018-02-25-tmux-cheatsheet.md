tmux is a powerful command line tool that allows sessions to run in the background.  I often use it when logging into a remote server and have a long-running process that needs to stay active. Without tmux I would have to leave my local terminal open which is something I don't want to do.  That being said, I can never remember the tmux commands so I wrote this cheat sheet for a quick reference.

### Session Management 
- `tmux ls` (or `tmux list-sessions`) - List sessions 
- `tmux new -s session-name` - Create new session
- `Ctrl-b d` - Detach from session 
- `tmux attach -t [session name]` - Attach to session `tmux kill-session -t session-name` - Kill session

- `Ctrl-b c` - Create new window 
- `Ctrl-b d` - Detach current client 
- `Ctrl-b l` - Move to previously selected window 
- `Ctrl-b n` - Move to the next window 
- `Ctrl-b p` - Move to the previous window 
- `Ctrl-b &` - Kill the current window 
- `Ctrl-b ,` - Rename the current window 
- `Ctrl-b q` - Show pane numbers (used to switch between panes) 
- `Ctrl-b o` - Switch to the next pane 
- `Ctrl-b ?` - List all keybindings 


### Moving Between Windows
- `Ctrl-b n` - Move to the next window
- `Ctrl-b p` - Move to the previous window
- `Ctrl-b l` - Move to the previously selected window
- `Ctrl-b w` - List all windows / window numbers
- `Ctrl-b window number` - Move to the specified window number (the default bindings are from 0 to 9) 


### Tiling Commands 
- `Ctrl-b %` - Split the window vertically
- `Ctrl-b "` - Split window horizontally
- `Ctrl-b o` - Goto next pane
- `Ctrl-b q` - Show pane numbers
- `Ctrl-b {` - Move the current pane left 
- `Ctrl-b }` - Move the current pane right
